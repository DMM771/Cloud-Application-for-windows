Welcome to my Cloud Application for windows.

Clients who wish to synchronize their own data with the cloud, may do so by selecting a foler on their computer. 
The client must choose a specific folder they wish to sync with the cloud.
The moment the client chooses to do so, all contents of the that folder will be uploaded to the cloud.
Other clients may choose to join the same cloud, if they do, any future changes in any client files, will synchronize with all clients,
and immediately, all client will see the change, and their files wil be updated.
This is done using a server.
The server, running all the time, keeps track of all clients, new and old, and simultaneously synchronizes all of them with corrisponding data.

Please feal free to use, and learn from my code.
Enjoy, and thanks for reading.
